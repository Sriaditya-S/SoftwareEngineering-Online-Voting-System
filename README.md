# Online Voting System

## Overview

The Online Voting System is a web-based application designed to modernize the voting process by providing a secure, accessible, and efficient platform for conducting elections. This system enables users to register, verify their identity, cast votes, and track real-time results—all from any location with internet access.

## Project Description

This project addresses the limitations of traditional voting methods by eliminating the need for physical polling stations. It is engineered to boost participation, reduce costs, and ensure rapid result tabulation while maintaining the highest standards of security and data integrity. The system is composed of two primary modules:

* **Administrative Module:** Allows election officials to manage voter information, configure elections, monitor the voting process, and generate results.
* **Voter Module:** Enables registered voters to view available elections, securely cast their votes, and access their voting history.

## Key Features

* **User Registration & Identity Verification:** Secure registration process with multi-factor authentication.
* **Election Management:** Creation, configuration, and administration of elections.
* **Secure Ballot Casting:** End-to-end encryption to safeguard the voting process.
* **Real-Time Result Tracking:** Immediate vote tallying and reporting.
* **Robust Security Measures:** Multi-layered security protocols including role-based access control, SSL/TLS encryption, and regular security audits.
* **Responsive Design:** Accessible across various devices and screen sizes.

## Tools & Frameworks

The project is built using modern, industry-standard tools and frameworks, including:

Front-End
•	React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
•	Vite: A modern build tool that provides fast development and optimized bundling.
•	CSS Libraries: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI
•	TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

Back-End
•	Node.js: A JavaScript runtime engine that executes code server-side.
•	Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features for web applications.
•	TypeScript (Back-End)

Database
•	MongoDB: A NoSQL document-oriented database.
•	Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library.

Version Control:
•	Git using platforms like GitHub and GitLab.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd online-voting-system
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   * For the backend:

     ```
4. **Configure the environment:**
   * Update database settings and API keys in the configuration files.
5. **Run the application:**
   * Start the backend service:
     ```sh
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
   * Start the frontend:
     ```sh
     npm start
     ```

## Usage

Once deployed, users can:

* **Register & Verify:** Create an account, submit required identification, and complete the verification process.
* **Cast a Vote:** Log in to access current elections, select candidates, and securely cast their vote.
* **Monitor Results:** View real-time vote counts and historical voting data through the dashboard.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

The system has been developed with testing at its core:

* **Unit Testing:** Conducted on individual components using frameworks like JUnit and Jest.
* **Integration Testing:** Ensures seamless interaction between frontend and backend components.
* **System Testing:** End-to-end testing, including performance, security, and usability tests.
* **Acceptance Testing:** Validated by stakeholders to ensure compliance with election regulations and user requirements.
